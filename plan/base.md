# Rationale 

1. Assign chords to all categories.
2. Chunk to scales in modular gaps. 
3. Rate all cadences in chromatic density. 
4. Assign cross-context keywords. 
5. Put the chunk position in NP weight. 
6. Do Monte-Carlo for the best riffs below.

CH–ND–HN → strongest tension pivot
ND–NC–NH → stabilizing loop
HD–CN–CD → pivot/connector
HC–NC–DC → cadence
CN–DC–HC → cadence
NH–ND–CN → stabilizing loop
DH–HD–CH → pivot/cadence 
NC–ND–CH → tension loop
HN–HD–CN → pivot/connector
DC–CH–DN → low tension pivot 
CD–HD–HN → pivot/surprise 
DN–HC–DC → cadence/transition

Optional: Run 50 seeds to obtain motif p-value.
