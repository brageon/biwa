# BIWA: Beneficial Impact Worldview Abstraction

BIWA is a framework for ethical and predictive decision modeling using **ontological nodes**. Built for scientists, strategists, system architects, and institutional designers.

<h2>Setup</h2>

```
git clone https://github.com/brageon/biwa.git
python3 -m pip install spacy, pickle
python3 oanc/king.py | sort -k2 -nr
```

<h2>Theory</h2>

Identify top two runes from uclassify.
```
1(Thuriaz, Algiz), 2(Isa, Laguz), 3(Jera, Nauthiz),
4(Kenaz, Inguz), 5(Othala, Fehu), 6(Raido, Uruz),
7(Ehwaz, Hagal), 8(Ansus, Ihwaz), 9(Pertho, Mannaz),
10(Gebo, Wunjo), 11(Dagaz, Birch), 12(Sun, Tiwaz).
```
Latour's ANT theory through springs:
   1. Problem: Scene or text. Plastic: asynch complex.
   2. Passage: RuneMaster. Stiff: synch simple.
   3. Inscription: Tonal center. Elastic: asynch simple.
   4. Mobility: Phishing. Diffusive: synch complex.
   5. Calculation: Chunking. Plastic: asynch complex.
   6. Blackbox: Software. Elastic: asynch simple.

Phishing from tonal folding spiral:
```
Bait, D/F: Edim7 Gm11 A#add9 Cadd9. Tor, Tyr, Kenaz, Ox.
Priming, C: Dm9 G13 FM7 C6/9 Gadd9. Isa, Dag, Fehu, Ehwaz, Ansuz.
Sustain, G: Am9 C CM9 D13 F#dim7. Perto, Hagal, Othala, Man, Sun.
Reel, A: Am6 A G#dim. Wunjo, Jera, Gebo.
Hook, B/E: EM6 C#m11 Badd9 EM7. Birch, Lake, Elk, Inguz.
Release, Ab: Baug G#M7 C#M7. Raido, Ihwaz, Naudiz.
CFG [time]: G13 Gadd9 D13 Cadd9 Edim7 A#add9.
GPCR cycle: priming, priming-sustain-bait, bait.
Why: Signal transduction, sensor+relay.
```

<h2>Application</h2>

"Priming-bait" due to C+F vibrations when seen by the R5 stabilizer Cadd9. 
```
BIWA has scientific merit because it predicts better than statistics.
When asked "will I be hired after the internship", BIWA answers "Yes,
"because you have Edim7+D13 and the job, which is then a heat pump, has Cadd9+Baug.
This gives F+G+Ab mh, as tonal centers, which is satisfactory for both parties."
No statistics would answer that question at all.
What field has "peer reviewers" for this?
