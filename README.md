# BIWA: Beneficial Impact

BIWA is a framework for ethical and predictive decision modeling using **ontological nodes**. Built for scientists, strategists, system architects, and institutional designers.

<h2>Setup</h2>

```
git clone https://github.com/brageon/biwa.git
python3 -m pip install spacy, pickle
python3 oanc/king.py | sort -k2 -nr
```

**Register**:

```
ES = 7DH3, 8NH9, 9HN8, 10CN7, 11NC6, 12ND.
TA = 6DN1, 5DC5, 4CH11, 3HD2, 2CD4, 1HC10. 
```


<h2>Application</h2>

Elastic: Asynch simple. Phishing. Diffusive: Synch complex. Below: Ehwaz-Tiwaz = CH. The response would be DC or NH.
```
BIWA has scientific merit because it predicts better than statistics.
When asked "will I be hired after the internship", BIWA answers "Yes,
"because you have Edim7+D13 and the job, which is then a heat pump, has Cadd9+Baug.
This gives F+G+Ab mh, as tonal centers, which is satisfactory for both parties."
No statistics would answer that question at all.
What field has "peer reviewers" for this?
```
 
**Scalability**: Ontology engine *or* tensor object. Plastic: Asynch complex.
