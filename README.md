# BIWA: Beneficial Inference Worldview Abstraction

BIWA is a framework for ethical and predictive decision modeling using **ontological nodes**. Built for scientists, strategists, system architects, and institutional designers.

<h2>Setup</h2>

```
git clone https://github.com/brageon/rest.git
python3 -m pip install spacy, pickle
python3 oanc/king.py | sort -k2 -nr
```

<h2>Impact</h2>

1. Identify top two runes from uclassify.
   * 1(Thurs, Algiz), 2(Isa, Laguz), 3(Jera, Naudiz),
   * 4(Kenaz, Inguz), 5(Othala, Fehu), 6(Raido, Uruz),
   * 7(Ehwaz, Hagal), 8(Ansus, Ihwaz), 9(Perto, Man),
   * 10(Gebo, Wunjo), 11(Dagaz, Birch), 12(Sun, Tyr).
1. Rank subtraction to M-zones (poker):
   * 8–14 big, 1–7 small, -1–5 conflict,
   * -6–10 accuse, -11–15 needy.
3. Latour's ANT taxonomy:
   * Problem: Scene or text. Asynch Complex.
   * Passage: RuneMaster. Synch Simple.
   * Inscription: Tonal center. Asynch Simple.
   * Mobility: Phishing. Synch Complex.
   * Calculation: Chunking. Asynch Complex.
   * Blackbox: Software. Asynch Simple. 

  
<h2>Worldview</h2>

1. Algorithm: ```RuneMaster → Micrologus → Chain```
2. Calculation: ```General – Pitch = Target```
3. Four chords show [Tonal Centers](http://www.micrologus.com/tools/online_harmonic_analyzer).
4. Absence of such is **asynchronous** word salad.
5. Ab minor harmonic is c5c6. Social function: release hook. 

<h2>Application</h2>

"Sustain" because of C, G vibes. It knows better than Perplexity who label it as "bait".
```
BIWA has scientific merit because it predicts better than statistics.
When asked "will I be hired after the internship", BIWA answers "Yes,
"because you have Edim7+D13 and the job, which is then a heat pump, has Cadd9+Baug.
This gives F+G+Ab mh, as tonal centers, which is satisfactory for both parties."
No statistics would answer that question at all.
What field has "peer reviewers" for this?
```
<h2>Abstract</h2>

1. Social Epistemology Journal. 
2. King: Word class clusters, i.e. ZSATGJ.
3. Amino: N-group, R-group, CO2 acid group.
4. WAIS: ZS=GAI-CPI, TG=QRI-NVI, J=AWM.
5. Bricks: RNA virus selecting amino groups.
