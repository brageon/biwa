# BIWA: Beneficial Impact Worldview Abstraction

BIWA is a framework for ethical and predictive decision modeling using **ontological nodes**. Built for scientists, strategists, system architects, and institutional designers.

<h2>Setup</h2>

```
git clone https://github.com/brageon/biwa.git
python3 -m pip install spacy, pickle
python3 oanc/king.py | sort -k2 -nr
git clone https://github.com/brageon/score.git
key from tensor.csv â†’ python3 biwa.py 
```

<h2>Theory</h2>

Identify top two runes from uclassify. Stiff: Synch simple.
```
1(Thuriaz, Algiz), 2(Isa, Laguz), 3(Jera, Nauthiz),
4(Kenaz, Inguz), 5(Othala, Fehu), 6(Raido, Uruz),
7(Ehwaz, Hagal), 8(Ansus, Ihwaz), 9(Pertho, Mannaz),
10(Gebo, Wunjo), 11(Dagaz, Birch), 12(Sun, Tiwaz).
```

<h2>Application</h2>

Tiwaz Ehwaz = 42%. Reverse: 68%. Elastic: Asynch simple.
```
BIWA has scientific merit because it predicts better than statistics.
When asked "will I be hired after the internship", BIWA answers "Yes,
"because you have Edim7+D13 and the job, which is then a heat pump, has Cadd9+Baug.
This gives F+G+Ab mh, as tonal centers, which is satisfactory for both parties."
No statistics would answer that question at all.
What field has "peer reviewers" for this?
```
Phishing. Diffusive: Synch complex. 

**Expansion:** Functional language or tensor object. Plastic: Asynch complex.
