<h2>Application</h2>

JavaScript: [ Asynch simple. (CD, ND, NH) time, help. ] Java: [ Asynch complex. (DC, HN, DN) praise, time. ] Python: [ Synch complex. (HC, NC, DH) gift, touch. ] C++: [ Synch simple. (CH, CN, HD) touch, help. ] LCIM: What comes after the gift (e.g. HD) decides the intention (DH mirror). 

1. DC (Deluge): Just because that’s how I look doesn’t mean I have to react in the same way. Not all [country] people react to the same things similarly.
2. CD (Belittle): Say that to my step mother in Rome. She would spank you with pasta {harmless}. 
3. HC (Martyr): Oh, now I have to carry the weight of representing a whole country? That’s heavy!
4. CH (Contempt): That’s such a basic observation. Try harder if you want to impress me.
5. ND (Pity): Aw, that’s cute. You must not meet many people if you think that.
6. DN (Guilt): Now I feel bad… like I should start speaking with my hands to fit in.
7. HN (Gaslight): A? No, I’m clearly B… your eyes are just tired.
8. NH (Sulking): Why does everyone always bring up my looks? Can’t they just..?
9. CN (Rivalry): So what? You look like a lost tourist who can’t order espresso.
10. NC (Blame): Don’t pin your stereotypes on me. That’s your filter, not mine.
11. HD (Greed): [country] looks? Then you owe me a glass of Barolo for noticing.
12. DH (Drama): Oh mamma mia! Am I in a Fellini movie now?
