# Reframing Concept

1. As long as it's not 3-4 pm on Tuesday, it works. # 12 after 5 in noise.
2. When on Tuesday did you have in mind. # 13 after 12 in signal. 
3. **Did you know that vultology is used to see temperament?** 
4. Don't think too much. At the interview I might be diplomat with clear goals.
5. At work or poker, I'm more focused, sorted.

3 Hi Daniel, hope you are well! 
4 How nice that you want to start working as a salesperson with us at Company.

6 Is it possible on Tuesday next week, 21/1 2025? All the best!

15 At work or poker, I'm more focused, sorted. Fehu
16 Corrected the ranking with indirect feedback. Man
17 I showed "benefactor" by being nonchalant as there is an asymmetrical balance of power. Dagaz
18 I make sales as a sales agent for the adrenaline rush. Tiwaz
19 Already have contact with sales managers on LinkedIn.
20 Good at outbound sales but have no product to sell. Man
21 Tried to make my own SaaS to provide sales training. Othala 
22 I rarely look at LinkedIn as people don't interest me. Tiwaz

24 People think I'm introvert because of "projection" as I already know they have nothing valuable. Ehwaz
